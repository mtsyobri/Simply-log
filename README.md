# Simply-log

To My group,Download the Github Desktop for easy sync

After logging in near the top left corner,there is Plus icon

click on it and Open Clone tab

There you should be able to Select "Simply-Log" Repository to sync(if you didnt see any repository to select refer to the second section)

once cloned,you will have your own local repository in your desired location

any changes made to the local repository can then be sync to the github repository

anybody that made changes will be logged can be reverted if you made any mistake


# Section 2

If you do not see any repository to select for cloning,then you haven't been added to the collaborators list

You need to give me your E-mail address and username for github


# Branches

If you want to work in private before making any final changes to the **Master Branch**

then simply make a **Branch**,after you are sure it is pretty much final make a **pull request**,then we can **merge** it to the **Master Branch**
